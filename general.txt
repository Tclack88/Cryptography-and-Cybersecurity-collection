ASLR

Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a computer security technique involved in protection from buffer overflow attacks. ASLR randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap, and libraries.

In short, when ASLR is turned on, the addresses of the stack, etc will be randomized. This causes a lot of difficulty in predicting addresses while exploitation.


To check the status:

cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
if it returns a 0, it's disabled
if it returns a 2, it's enabled

To Dissable:

echo "0" | [sudo] dd of=/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

To Enable:

echo "2" | [sudo] dd of=/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

tcpdump -i wsp3s0 (<-- or wlan, etc)

Who is on your wifi?
ifconfig   -- look for the ip in the wifi and netmask. I get:
inet 192.168.86.242  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.86.255
Which tells me the first 24 bytes are masked, so we scan the rest:
sudo nmap -sn 192.186.86.0/24
