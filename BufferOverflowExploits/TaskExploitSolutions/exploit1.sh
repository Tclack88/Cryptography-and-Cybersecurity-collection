# Sorry, I couldn't quite get execv to work with a pure program, I just couldn't
# get execv() to work. Since I did this first through the command line with 
# inline python commands above, rather than trying to figure out how to do it 
# with python, I figured it was worth my time to try and move on and solve the 
# rest
