an mp3 audo file is provided.

## Solution
It sounds like morse code. I actually happen to know morse code already.

The one problem is twice, a `.-.-` pattern shows up. I immediately recognized it as C but backwards `-.-.`. So this cued me into playing it backwards. I transcribed it manually, but also reversed it and provided it in the directory

`SVBGRAUDACITYROCKS`

Adding in the "{" and "}" completes it

NOTE: This wasn't accepted at first. Which made me thing the Audacity hint was merelty a next clue to follow. So I went down the rabbit hole of examining spectrograms, trying to filter different frequencies. It turns out the problem was a trailing space "SVBGR{AUDACITYROCKS} " instead of "SVBGR{AUDACITYROCKS}" Frustrating!
